## Overview

Passive components — resistors, capacitors, and inductors — are the fundamental building blocks of every electronic circuit. Unlike active devices (transistors, diodes), passive components do not amplify signals. They control current flow, store energy, filter signals, set time constants, and provide impedance matching. A typical circuit board contains 5-20 passive components for every active device.

In the bootstrap chain, passive components bridge [electrical systems](electrical-systems.md) (power distribution) and [semiconductor devices](../silicon/basic-devices.md) (active electronics). Without capacitors, power supplies produce unusable rippled DC. Without resistors, transistor bias circuits cannot function. Without inductors, switching power converters and radio-frequency circuits are impossible.

This document covers construction methods for each passive component type at three levels: hand-built (survival/bootstrap), workshop (small-batch production), and industrial (automated mass production). The emphasis is on materials, construction techniques, and achievable parameter ranges at each level.

## Process Description

## 4.1 Resistor Construction

#### Carbon Composition Resistors

1. Mix carbon powder with ceramic binder (clay or phenolic resin) in ratios from 5:1 (low resistance, ~10 Ω) to 1:10 (high resistance, ~10 MΩ). The carbon-to-binder ratio determines resistivity.
2. Press mixture into cylindrical pellets (6 mm dia × 18 mm long for ½W rating) at 50-100 MPa.
3. Embed tinned copper lead wires (0.6 mm dia, 30 mm long) into each end of the pellet before pressing.
4. Fire at 300-500°C for 1-2 hours to cure binder. Do not exceed 600°C — carbon oxidizes in air above 700°C.
5. Measure resistance. Sort into tolerance bands (±5%, ±10%, ±20%).
6. Coat with insulating paint or lacquer. Color-code with resistance value bands.
7. Mark value with paint bands (4-band or 5-band color code).

**Achievable range**: 1 Ω to 22 MΩ. Power ratings: ¼W to 2W. Tolerance: ±10-20% (hand-made), ±5% (controlled process).

**Strengths**:
- Simple construction from two abundant materials (carbon and ceramic binder) — no precision wire or thin-film deposition equipment needed
- Excellent pulse-energy handling: carbon mass absorbs transient energy that would vaporize a thin film (useful for spark-gap protection and surge suppression)
- Wide resistance range (1 Ω to 22 MΩ) from a single construction method by varying carbon-to-binder ratio

**Weaknesses**:
- Poor long-term stability: moisture absorption and carbon oxidation cause 5-15% drift over 1000 hours at 70°C
- High noise: carbon granularity generates current noise 10-100× higher than film types — unusable for low-level audio or precision measurement circuits
- Large voltage coefficient (200-2000 ppm/V): resistance changes with applied voltage, introducing distortion in AC circuits

#### Wire-Wound Resistors

1. Select resistance wire: nichrome (Ni-Cr 80/20, ρ = 1.10 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m) or constantan (Cu-Ni 55/45, ρ = 0.49 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m).
2. Calculate wire length: L = R × A / ρ, where A is wire cross-section area.
3. Wind wire tightly onto ceramic or fiberglass core (3-15 mm dia × 10-50 mm long). For non-inductive winding, use bifilar technique (fold wire in half, wind both halves together — opposing fields cancel).
4. Secure wire ends with mechanical clamps or spot-weld to terminal lugs.
5. Coat with vitreous enamel (fire at 700-900°C) or silicone cement for high-power types.

**Achievable range**: 0.1 Ω to 100 kΩ. Power ratings: 1W to 200W. Tolerance: ±1-5%. Inductance is a concern — use bifilar winding for precision or high-frequency applications.

**Strengths**:
- Highest power dissipation of all resistor types (up to 200W) — wire and ceramic core tolerate extreme temperatures
- Excellent long-term stability (±0.1-1% over 1000 hours at 70°C) and lowest temperature coefficient (±20-100 ppm/°C with nichrome or constantan)
- Tight tolerance (±1-5%) achievable through precise wire length calculation and measurement

**Weaknesses**:
- Parasitic inductance from helical winding makes them unsuitable above ~100 kHz without bifilar winding technique (which doubles wire consumption)
- Limited resistance range (0.1 Ω to 100 kΩ) — high values require impractically long, thin wire
- Bulky and expensive compared to film types — a 2W wire-wound resistor is 5-10× larger than a 2W metal film

#### Film Resistors (Metal Film / Carbon Film)

1. Deposit thin resistive film onto ceramic rod (2-4 mm dia × 6-12 mm long). Carbon film: pyrolytic deposition from hydrocarbon gas at 900-1100°C. Metal film: sputtering or evaporation of Ni-Cr alloy (50-200 nm thick).
2. Cut a helical groove through the film using a diamond-tipped cutting tool. The groove lengthens the current path, increasing resistance. Trim to target value by adjusting groove pitch.
3. Crimp end caps with lead wires. Coat with epoxy.

**Achievable range**: 1 Ω to 10 MΩ. Power: ⅛W to 1W. Tolerance: ±0.1-1%. Best stability and lowest noise of all types.

**Strengths**:
- Tightest tolerance (±0.1-1%) and best stability (±0.1-0.5% over 1000 hours at 70°C) — laser-trimmed helical groove enables precision matching
- Lowest noise of any resistor type (no carbon granularity, no inductive winding) — required for precision analog circuits and medical instrumentation
- Excellent frequency response (>100 MHz) due to non-inductive construction and thin resistive layer

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires sputtering or evaporation equipment for metal film deposition — not achievable at bench scale without vacuum systems
- Limited power handling (⅛W to 1W) — thin film (50-200 nm) cannot dissipate high energy without damage
- Sensitive to electrostatic discharge during handling — the thin film can be damaged by voltage spikes that a carbon composition resistor would absorb

## 4.2 Capacitor Construction

#### Ceramic Disc Capacitors

1. Mix BaTiO₃ powder with organic binder (paraffin wax or PVA). Press into discs (5-15 mm dia × 1-3 mm thick) at 50-100 MPa.
2. Sinter at 1200-1350°C for 1-4 hours. Cool slowly (2-5°C/min through Curie point at ~120°C for BaTiO₃) to achieve desired crystal structure.
3. Apply silver paste electrodes to both faces. Fire at 600-800°C for 10-20 minutes to bond silver to ceramic.
4. Solder tinned copper leads (0.6 mm dia) to silver electrodes.
5. Dip in phenolic or epoxy coating for insulation and moisture protection.

**Achievable range**: 1 pF to 100 nF (Class 1, NP0/C0G), 100 pF to 10 μF (Class 2, X7R/Y5V). Voltage ratings: 50V to 5000V. Tolerance: ±5% (Class 1), +80/-20% (Class 2).

**Strengths**:
- Excellent frequency characteristics: Class 1 (C0G/NP0) types have near-zero temperature coefficient (0 ±30 ppm/°C) and negligible dissipation factor (<0.1%), making them ideal for RF tuning and oscillator circuits
- High voltage capability (up to 5000V) in a compact disc format — no other capacitor type matches this voltage-per-volume ratio at low capacitance values
- Simple construction from BaTiO₃ ceramic and silver paste — no electrolyte, no polymer film, minimal equipment beyond a kiln

**Weaknesses**:
- Class 2 ceramics (X7R/Y5V) exhibit severe capacitance change with temperature (+80/-20% over -55 to 125°C for Y5V) and applied voltage (capacitance drops 30-80% at rated DC voltage)
- Barium titanate powder is toxic if ingested — requires careful handling during production, and fired components pose dust hazard if cracked or machined
- Limited maximum capacitance for Class 1 types (≤100 nF) — larger values require physically impractical disc sizes or stacked configurations

#### Electrolytic Capacitors (Wet)

1. Etch aluminum foil (0.05-0.1 mm thick) in HCl or NaOH solution to increase surface area 20-200×. Etch pit depth: 1-50 μm.
2. Form the dielectric (Al₂O₃) by anodizing the etched foil in boric acid or ammonium pentaborate solution at 50-600V DC. Oxide thickness: 1.2-1.5 nm/V of formation voltage. Formation time: 30-120 minutes.
3. Layer: anode foil + electrolyte-soaked paper separator + cathode foil. Roll into cylindrical winding (6-35 mm dia × 10-50 mm long).
4. Insert winding into aluminum can. Impregnate with electrolyte (ethylene glycol + boric acid + ammonium salts, resistivity 100-300 Ω·cm).
5. Seal with rubber bung and aluminum lid. Crimp or weld closure. Form safety vent (scored aluminum or rubber plug that releases at 2-10 atm).

**Achievable range**: 0.1 μF to 1 F. Voltage: 3V to 600V. Tolerance: ±20%. ESR: 0.01-10 Ω depending on size/frequency. Lifetime: 2000-15,000 hours at rated temperature (85°C or 105°C).

**Strengths**:
- Highest capacitance per unit volume of any capacitor type — etched aluminum foil increases effective surface area 20-200×, enabling 1 F in a 35 mm diameter can
- Lowest cost per microfarad for bulk energy storage — standard filtering and decoupling in every power supply design
- Self-healing oxide layer: the Al₂O₃ dielectric can re-form during operation if minor localized breakdowns occur (the anodization process continues in the electrolyte)

**Weaknesses**:
- Polarized — reverse polarity or AC voltage causes rapid gas generation, pressure buildup, and violent venting or explosion of the aluminum can
- Limited lifetime: electrolyte gradually dries out and decomposes, causing ESR to increase and capacitance to drop 20% per 1000 hours at 85°C — the component has a defined wear-out mechanism
- Wide tolerance (±20%) and high temperature coefficient (±0.5-2%/°C) — unsuitable for precision timing or filtering applications

#### Film Capacitors

1. Draw [polymer film](../polymers/thermoplastics.md) to 2-20 μm thickness (polyester, polypropylene, or polycarbonate).
2. Vacuum-deposit aluminum (20-50 nm) onto one or both sides of film as electrodes. Alternatively, use separate metal foil layers.
3. Wind two metallized films offset by 1-2 mm (so each extends beyond the other on opposite sides). Roll into cylindrical or rectangular form.
4. Spray zinc or solder metal end coatings (schoopage) to contact the exposed metal edges on each end.
5. Attach leads to end coatings by soldering or welding. Encapsulate in epoxy.

**Achievable range**: 100 pF to 100 μF. Voltage: 50V to 2000V. Tolerance: ±1-5%. Self-healing: metallized types clear localized shorts by evaporating the thin metal around the fault.

**Strengths**:
- Self-healing metallized construction: localized dielectric breakdowns evaporate the surrounding 20-50 nm aluminum layer, isolating the fault without catastrophic failure — critical for high-reliability applications
- Tight tolerance (±1-5%) and excellent long-term stability with no wear-out mechanism — no electrolyte to dry out, no oxide to degrade
- Very low dissipation factor (<0.1% for polypropylene) makes film capacitors ideal for high-frequency resonant circuits, snubbers, and AC motor run applications

**Weaknesses**:
- Large physical size per unit capacitance compared to ceramic or electrolytic types — a 10 μF film capacitor is 10-50× larger than an equivalent ceramic
- Metallization step requires vacuum deposition equipment (thermal evaporation of aluminum at 10⁻³ to 10⁻² mbar) — adds process complexity not needed for ceramic or electrolytic types
- Upper capacitance limit (~100 μF) constrained by physical winding dimensions — cannot replace electrolytic capacitors for bulk energy storage

## 4.3 Inductor Construction

1. Select core material: air core (no core, lowest inductance), iron powder (μᵣ = 10-100), ferrite (μᵣ = 500-15,000). Core geometry: rod, toroid, E-core, pot core.
2. Calculate turns: N = √(L × l / (μ₀ × μᵣ × A)), where L = desired inductance, l = magnetic path length, A = core cross-section area.
3. Wind copper magnet wire (enameled, 0.05-2.0 mm dia) onto core. Layer winding for solenoids; sectional or progressive winding for high-frequency toroids.
4. For E-core or pot core types: assemble core halves around winding, clamp or cement. Gap the core (insert paper or plastic shim) to prevent saturation: gap length l_g = μ₀ × N² × A / L.
5. Insulate and secure winding with tape or varnish dip (impregnate at 100-130°C for 1-4 hours to improve thermal and mechanical stability).
6. Tin lead ends by removing enamel (mechanically or with solder pot at 400-450°C).

**Achievable range**: 1 nH to 100 H. Current: 1 mA to 1000A (size-dependent). Frequency: DC to 100 MHz (core-dependent).

**Strengths**:
- Wide parameter range from a single construction method: changing core material, wire gauge, and turn count tunes inductance over 11 orders of magnitude (1 nH to 100 H)
- Energy storage capability (½LI²) enables switching power converter operation — no other passive component stores current-based energy
- Ferrite core inductors achieve high inductance in small volumes (μᵣ up to 15,000) — a 10 mH toroidal inductor fits in a 25 mm diameter × 15 mm height package

**Weaknesses**:
- Core saturation: increasing DC bias current beyond the core's flux density limit (0.3-0.5 T for ferrite, 1.0-1.5 T for iron powder) causes inductance to drop precipitously, potentially damaging the switching transistor
- Parasitic capacitance between winding layers limits high-frequency performance — self-resonant frequency (SRF) typically 1-100 MHz, above which the inductor behaves as a capacitor
- Manual winding of toroidal cores is labor-intensive and inconsistent — production-scale toroid winding machines are specialized equipment that take significant effort to construct

## Scaling Notes

## From Workshop to Production

- **Bench scale**: Hand-wind coils, hand-mix carbon resistor compositions. Output: 10-50 components per day. Resistance tolerance ±20%. Suitable for prototyping and one-off circuits.
- **Pilot scale**: Semi-automatic winding machines, hydraulic press for ceramic discs. Output: 100-1000 components per day. Tolerance improves to ±5-10%. Justifies dedicated resistor/capacitor production lines.
- **Production scale**: Automated winding, tape-and-reel packaging, automated testing and sorting. Output: 10,000-1,000,000 components per day. Tolerance ±0.1-1%. Laser trimming for precision resistors achieves ±0.01%.

## Scale Bottlenecks

- **Wire drawing**: Consistent magnet wire requires precision dies and annealing ovens. Wire diameter variation of ±5% causes inductance variation of ±10%.
- **Ceramic sintering**: Kiln temperature uniformity (±5°C) directly affects dielectric constant and capacitor tolerance. Batch-to-batch variation dominates over within-batch variation.
- **Ferrite processing**: Sintering atmosphere (air vs. nitrogen) and cooling rate through Curie temperature control permeability within a factor of 2-3×. Requires tight process control for repeatable inductors.
- **Etching (electrolytic capacitors)**: Etch uniformity across the foil determines capacitance consistency. Foil-to-foil variation of ±20% is common.

## Minimum Economic Scale

A workshop producing 500-1000 passive components per week justifies dedicated winding and pressing equipment. Below this, hand-wound coils and hand-mixed resistors suffice for circuit prototyping.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Probable Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Resistor drift >10% over time | Moisture absorption in carbon comp | Coat with moisture-resistant lacquer; use film resistors instead |
| Carbon resistor value too high | Insufficient carbon content or poor mixing | Increase carbon-to-binder ratio; mix longer for homogeneity |
| Wire-wound resistor inductance causes oscillation | Inductive winding at high frequency | Use bifilar (non-inductive) winding; switch to film resistor |
| Capacitor short circuit | Dielectric breakdown from overvoltage | Derate voltage to 50-70% of rating; use thicker dielectric |
| Electrolytic capacitor bulging/venting | Internal pressure from electrolyte decomposition | Check for reverse polarity; reduce ripple current; replace |
| Electrolytic capacitor high ESR | Electrolyte drying out | Replace; operate below 85°C; use higher-temperature rated part |
| Film capacitor value shifts with temperature | Wrong dielectric material | Switch from polyester (high TC) to polypropylene (low TC) |
| Inductor saturates at lower current than expected | Core gap too small or missing | Increase core gap length; use larger core cross-section |
| Toroid winding has high inter-winding capacitance | Turns wound too uniformly (layered) | Use progressive (sector) winding to reduce distributed capacitance |
| Ferrite core cracks during assembly | Mechanical stress from clamping | Use cushioning gasket; do not over-tighten clamps |
| Resistor noise in audio circuits | Carbon composition type inherently noisy | Replace with metal film (lower noise by 10-100×) |

## Safety

- **Electrolytic capacitor explosion risk**: Electrolytic capacitors contain volatile electrolyte. Reverse polarity, overvoltage, or excessive ripple current causes internal heating, gas generation, and pressure buildup. The safety vent is designed to release at 2-10 atm — but if the vent fails, the can ruptures violently, spraying hot electrolyte (corrosive, contains boric acid and organic solvents). Wear eye protection when working with large electrolytic capacitors (>100 μF, >50V). Discharge all capacitors through a 100-1000 Ω resistor before handling. Never apply AC voltage to a polarized capacitor.
- **Ceramic dust inhalation**: Grinding or sanding fired ceramic capacitors and ferrite cores generates fine silica and metal oxide dust (BaTiO₃, Fe₂O₃, MnO). Use dust extraction and a particulate respirator (N95 or better). Barium compounds are toxic if ingested — wash hands after handling BaTiO₃ powder.
- **Wire drawing hazards**: Drawing fine magnet wire involves high-speed rotating capstans and sharp dies. Pinch points. The soapy drawing lubricant is slippery — keep floors clear. Burns from annealing ovens at 400-600°C — use heat-resistant gloves.
- **Lead solder fumes**: When tinning resistor or capacitor leads with Sn/Pb solder, lead oxide fumes and flux vapors are generated. Use local exhaust ventilation (fume extractor at 0.3-0.5 m/s capture velocity). Lead-free solder (SAC305, Sn/Cu) eliminates lead exposure but requires higher temperatures (217-227°C).
- **Kiln/furnace hazards**: Sintering ceramics and ferrites requires 1000-1350°C kilns. Surface temperature of kiln exterior: 60-120°C — burn risk. Use thermal gloves and face shield when loading/unloading. Ensure adequate ventilation — organic binders burn off during firing, producing CO, CO₂, and volatile organic compounds.

## Quality Control

## Resistor Testing
- **Resistance measurement**: 4-wire (Kelvin) method for values <10 Ω. Bridge or DMM for 10 Ω to 10 MΩ. Accuracy requirement: 4× better than the tolerance being verified (e.g., measure ±5% resistors to ±1.25%).
- **Temperature coefficient test**: Measure resistance at -55°C, +25°C, +125°C. Calculate TCR = (R₂-R₁)/(R₁ × (T₂-T₁)). Must be within specified ppm/°C range.
- **Load life test**: Apply rated power at 70°C for 1000 hours. Resistance drift must remain within ±5% (carbon comp) or ±1% (film).
- **Voltage coefficient test**: Measure at 10% and 100% rated voltage. Carbon composition: VCR <2000 ppm/V. Film: VCR <1 ppm/V.

## Capacitor Testing
- **Capacitance and dissipation factor**: Measure at 1 kHz (1 MHz for small ceramics) using LCR meter or capacitance bridge. Tolerance must match specification.
- **Insulation resistance**: Apply rated voltage DC for 60 seconds. Leakage current: I < 0.01 × C × V (μA). Equivalent: IR > 100/C (MΩ·μF product). Lower limit: 1000 MΩ for ceramic, 10,000 MΩ for film.
- **Voltage proof (hi-pot)**: Apply 2-3× rated voltage for 5-60 seconds. No breakdown or flashover.
- **ESR measurement**: At 100 kHz for electrolytic, compare to specification. ESR increase >50% from initial value indicates degradation.

## Inductor Testing
- **Inductance measurement**: LCR meter at operating frequency. Tolerance: typically ±5-10%.
- **Saturation current test**: Increase DC bias current until inductance drops 10-30% from zero-bias value. Record I_sat. Must meet or exceed rated value.
- **Core loss measurement**: Apply AC voltage at operating frequency. Measure core temperature rise. Calculate loss from temperature rise: P_core = m × C_p × ΔT/Δt.
- **Hi-pot test**: 500-2000V between winding and core for 60 seconds. Leakage <1 mA.

## Variations and Alternatives

| Component Type | Alternative | Trade-off |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Carbon comp resistor | Metal film resistor | Film has better stability, lower noise, tighter tolerance; carbon comp handles transient pulses better |
| Wire-wound resistor | Thick film (cermet) resistor | Thick film is non-inductive, smaller; wire-wound handles higher power, lower TCR |
| Ceramic capacitor | Mica capacitor | Mica has better stability and lower loss; ceramic has higher volumetric efficiency |
| Electrolytic capacitor | Tantalum capacitor | Tantalum has higher CV per volume, lower ESR; but higher cost and failure mode is dramatic (ignition) |
| Aluminum electrolytic | Solid polymer electrolytic | Polymer has much lower ESR, longer life; but lower voltage range (2-35V) and higher cost |
| Film capacitor | Paper capacitor (oil-filled) | Paper/oil handles higher voltage and power; film has lower loss and better stability |
| Ferrite core inductor | Iron powder core inductor | Iron powder has higher saturation (1.0-1.5T vs. 0.3-0.5T); ferrite has lower loss at high frequency |
| Toroidal inductor | E-core inductor | Toroid has lower EMI radiation and higher inductance per turn; E-core is easier to wind and allows gap adjustment |

## Historical Bootstrap Methods
- **Early resistors**: Pencil lead (carbon-clay composite, ~20-200 Ω depending on hardness). Length of nichrome wire wrapped on a form. Lamp black (soot) mixed with shellac.
- **Early capacitors**: Leyden jar (glass jar with tin foil inside and outside, ~100-1000 pF at 10-50 kV). Mica sheets with tin foil layers. Paper soaked in beeswax with aluminum foil.
- **Early inductors**: Coils wound on wooden or cardboard forms. Iron wire bundles as cores (high loss but available early). Crystal radio coils: 50-200 turns of wire on oatmeal box (air core, 100-500 μH).

## Regional Adaptations
- Where barium is unavailable, use titanium dioxide (TiO₂, εᵣ ≈ 100) for ceramic capacitors instead of BaTiO₃ (εᵣ ≈ 1000-10000). Lower capacitance per volume but adequate for many applications.
- Where petrochemical-derived polymer films are unavailable, use oil-impregnated paper as capacitor dielectric. Voltage rating and reliability are lower, but functional.
- Where nickel-chromium alloy is unavailable for resistance wire, use iron wire (ρ = 0.97 × 10⁻⁷ Ω·m, high TCR of +5000 ppm/°C) or constantan if copper-nickel alloy is available.
