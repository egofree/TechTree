## Overview

Pulp and paper chemicals enable the conversion of wood and plant fibers into paper, cardboard, and cellulose-derived materials. The industry consumes enormous volumes of chemicals: sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium sulfide (Na₂S), chlorine dioxide (ClO₂), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), alum (aluminum sulfate), and various sizing and coating agents. Beyond paper, the kraft pulping process yields tall oil (rosin, fatty acids) and lignin as valuable chemical byproducts, and dissolving-grade pulp is the feedstock for regenerated cellulose (viscose rayon, cellulose acetate, and emerging nanocellulose materials).

## Raw Materials

**Wood**: The primary fiber source. Softwoods (pine, spruce, fir): long fibers (3-5 mm) → strong paper (kraft linerboard, packaging). Hardwoods (eucalyptus, birch, aspen): short fibers (0.8-1.5 mm) → smooth paper (printing, tissue). Wood composition: cellulose 40-50%, hemicellulose 20-30%, lignin 20-30%, extractives (resins, terpenes, tannins) 2-5%. Chemical pulping removes lignin to separate and liberate fibers.

**Alternative fiber sources**: Cotton linters (pure cellulose → high-quality paper, currency), hemp, flax, bagasse (sugar cane residue), bamboo, straw (agricultural waste — serious seasonal pollution issues in developing countries from straw pulping), and recycled paper (50-60% of global feedstock — deinking chemicals required).

## Kraft Pulping Process (Dominant — 80% of Chemical Pulp)

**White liquor preparation**: NaOH + Na₂S solution. Sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) purchased or produced from salt + sulfuric acid → reduced to Na₂S in the recovery furnace by carbon (from burned black liquor): Na₂SO₄ + 4C → Na₂S + 4CO. Causticizing: Na₂CO₃ (from recovery furnace) + Ca(OH)₂ → NaOH + CaCO₃. CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ in lime kiln. CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime). The kraft chemical cycle is a closed loop — inorganic chemicals are recovered and reused with >95% efficiency.

**Digester**: Wood chips (20-30 mm) cooked with white liquor at 160-175°C for 1-3 hours. Lignin reacts with NaOH and Na₂S: Na₂S hydrolyzes to NaSH + NaOH. Sulfide ions (HS⁻) attack lignin β-aryl ether bonds, fragmenting the polymer into smaller, alkali-soluble fragments. Simultaneously, NaOH saponifies ester bonds and neutralizes acidic groups. H-factor (reaction severity) combines temperature and time into a single parameter. Batch digesters: 100-300 m³, 8-12 charges per day. Continuous digesters (Kamyr): chip column moves downward through impregnation, cooking, and wash zones — superior uniformity and energy efficiency.

**Black liquor**: The spent cooking liquor — contains dissolved lignin (as alkali lignin), hemicellulose degradation products, and the inorganic cooking chemicals. Concentration: 15-18% solids from digester, concentrated in multi-effect evaporators to 65-80% solids. **Recovery boiler**: Concentrated black liquor burned — organic material (lignin, hemicellulose) provides fuel energy (recovery boiler generates steam for the mill — modern kraft mills are energy self-sufficient), inorganic sodium salts melt and drain from the furnace bottom as smelt (Na₂CO₃ + Na₂S). Smelt dissolved in water → green liquor → causticized with lime → white liquor (NaOH + Na₂S) returned to digester. Recovery boiler is the heart of a kraft mill — a single point of failure that shuts the entire mill if it trips.

**Brown stock washing**: Pulp fibers separated from black liquor by counter-current washing on rotary vacuum washers or diffusion washers. Efficient washing is critical — residual lignin in pulp causes dark color and consumes extra bleaching chemicals. Wash water: 8-15 m³ per tonne of pulp. Filtrate (weak black liquor) sent to evaporation and recovery.

**Tall oil recovery**: Black liquor from softwood pulping contains 3-6% soap (sodium salts of resin acids and fatty acids, derived from wood extractives). Soap skims from liquor surface during evaporation (soap separates as pH drops and concentration increases). Acidified with H₂SO₄ → crude tall oil (CTO). CTO distilled: heads (palmitic acid, boiling <200°C), tall oil fatty acids (TOFA, 200-260°C, primarily oleic and linoleic acids — used in alkyd resins, soaps, and epoxidized as plasticizer), tall oil rosin (TOR, >260°C, primarily abietic and pimaric acids — used in paper sizing, adhesives, and printing inks), and pitch residue (fuel). Global CTO production: ~2 million tonnes/year.

## Bleaching Chemistry

Unbleached kraft pulp is dark brown. Bleaching removes residual lignin to produce white pulp for printing and writing papers. Modern bleaching uses elemental-chlorine-free (ECF) sequences — chlorine gas (Cl₂) replaced by chlorine dioxide (ClO₂) and supplementary oxidants.

**ClO₂ generation**: Sodium chlorate (NaClO₃) reduced by methanol in sulfuric acid medium: 6NaClO₃ + CH₃OH + 6H₂SO₄ → 6ClO₂ + 6NaHSO₄ + CO₂ + 5H₂O. ClO₂ absorbed in cold water (7-10 g/L) and stored/transported as chilled solution. On-site generation mandatory — ClO₂ cannot be stored or transported as gas (explosive at >10 kPa partial pressure). Alternative generation: electrolytic (NaCl → Cl₂ → ClO₂), or hydrogen peroxide reduction of NaClO₃.

**[Typical ECF sequence](../glossary/typical-ecf-sequence.md)** (D₀EopD₁EPD₂): (1) **[D₀](../glossary/d-chemistry.md)** — ClO₂ at pH 2.5-3.5, 50-70°C, 30-60 min. Oxidizes lignin (electron transfer — ClO₂ reduced to ClO₂⁻) but does not chlorinate (unlike Cl₂, which forms chlorinated organics including dioxins). (2) **[Eop](../glossary/eop.md)** — NaOH extraction with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide reinforcement at 70-80°C. Dissolves oxidized lignin fragments. O₂ and H₂O₂ provide additional delignification without chlorine. (3) **[D₁](../glossary/d-chemistry-2.md)** — second ClO₂ stage, higher temperature (70-75°C). Further bleaching. (4) **[EP](../glossary/ep.md)** — alkaline extraction with H₂O₂. (5) **[D₂](../glossary/d-chemistry-3.md)** — final ClO₂ stage, targets >88% ISO brightness.

**Totally chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching**: No chlorine-containing chemicals. Sequence: O₂ → H₂O₂ → O₃ (ozone). Ozone generated on-site by corona discharge (air or O₂ feed, 5-15% O₃ by weight). O₃ is an extremely powerful oxidant — must be carefully controlled to avoid cellulose degradation (loss of fiber strength). TCF produces zero chlorinated organic compounds in effluent — environmentally superior but more expensive and slightly lower brightness ceiling than ECF. Dominant in Scandinavia.

## Papermaking Chemicals

**Internal sizing**: Makes paper water-resistant (prevents ink feathering and wet-strength loss). **Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD)**: Reactive size — reacts with cellulose hydroxyl groups forming covalent β-ketoester bonds. Added to pulp slurry before paper machine. Cures over 1-7 days after papermaking. **Alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA)**: Faster curing than AKD (reacts on the paper machine). Both supplied as aqueous emulsions (cationic starch stabilizer). Dosage: 0.05-0.3% on dry fiber weight.

**Wet strength resins**: Cationic polyamideamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin — cross-links cellulose fibers via covalent bonds that resist water. Used in tissue paper, paper towels, liquid packaging board, and paper bags. Without wet strength resin, paper loses >90% of its tensile strength when saturated with water. With PAE: retains 20-40% of dry strength. Dosage: 0.5-3% on dry fiber.

**Fillers and coating pigments**: Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) or ground calcium carbonate (GCC) — added to paper to improve opacity, brightness, smoothness, and printability while reducing fiber cost (CaCO₃ cheaper than fiber). PCC produced on-site by calcining limestone (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂), slaking (CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂), then precipitating CaCO₃ by bubbling CO₂ through the lime milk — crystal morphology controlled (scalenohedral, rhombohedral, or needle-like aragonite) for optimal light scattering. Kaolin clay (aluminum silicate): coating pigment for smooth paper surface. Applied as blade coating (excess coating applied, then metered off with a steel blade — coat weight 5-20 g/m² per side).

**Retention aids**: Cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) and bentonite clay — flocculate fine particles (fillers, fines) onto fiber surfaces, preventing them from washing through the paper machine wire into the white water. Retention >80% essential for economic filler use and clean water circuits. Microparticle retention system (CPAM + bentonite) forms small, dense flocs that drain well and give good formation (uniform fiber distribution).

**Defoamers and pitch control**: Silicone or mineral oil-based defoamers prevent foam in pulp washing and papermaking. Pitch (wood resin) deposits on equipment — controlled by talc addition (adsorbs pitch) or surfactant addition (keeps pitch dispersed).

## Dissolving Pulp and Cellulose Derivatives

**Dissolving pulp**: Ultra-high-purity cellulose (>90% α-cellulose, minimal hemicellulose). Produced by prehydrolysis kraft (wood chips pre-treated with steam at 170°C to hydrolyze hemicellulose, then kraft pulped) or acid sulfite process (acidic cooking with Ca/Mg/Na bisulfite + SO₂). Used for: viscose rayon, cellulose acetate (film, fiber, cigarette filters), cellulose ethers (carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose — food, pharmaceutical, construction applications), and emerging nanocellulose materials.

**Viscose rayon**: Dissolving pulp steeped in 18% NaOH → alkali cellulose. Pressed, shredded, aged (depolymerized to target molecular weight). Reacted with CS₂ (carbon disulfide) → sodium cellulose xanthate (orange crumb). Dissolved in dilute NaOH → viscose solution. Filtered, deaerated, ripened. Extruded through spinneret into H₂SO₄/Na₂SO₄ coagulation bath → regenerated cellulose filaments. CS₂ is toxic (neurological effects) and the process generates H₂S and CS₂ emissions — major environmental concern. Lyocell process (NMMO solvent) is a cleaner alternative: cellulose dissolved directly in N-methylmorpholine N-oxide monohydrate at 100-130°C, then extruded into water bath → regenerated cellulose. Solvent recovered (>99.5%) and recycled. No CS₂ or H₂S.

**Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)**: Dissolving pulp treated with 64% H₂SO₄ at 45°C for 30-60 minutes — acid hydrolyzes amorphous cellulose, leaving crystalline rod-shaped nanoparticles (5-20 nm diameter, 100-300 nm length). Extraordinary mechanical properties: Young's modulus ~150 GPa (stiffer than Kevlar), tensile strength ~7 GPa. Applications: nanocomposite reinforcement, biomedical scaffolds, iridescent films (self-assembly into chiral nematic structures), rheology modifier, security features (optical signatures). Commercial production: CelluForce (Canada), Melodea (Israel).

## Safety & Hazards

- **Sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide**: White liquor causes severe chemical burns. PPE: acid-resistant gloves, face shield, chemical suit. Emergency showers in all pulping areas. Na₂S releases H₂S (rotten egg gas, toxic — IDLH 100 ppm, deadens olfactory nerve at higher concentrations making it impossible to smell) on contact with acid.
- **Chlorine dioxide**: Explosive gas — cannot be concentrated. Generated on-site at <10 g/L in chilled water. Toxic by inhalation. Gas detection systems mandatory in bleach plant. Scrubbers on all vent streams.
- **Recovery boiler explosion risk**: Smelt-water explosion — water contacting molten smelt (Na₂CO₃/Na₂S at 800-1000°C) causes violent steam explosion. Multiple safety systems: dissolving tank with agitator (smelt flows through spout into water), emergency shutdown procedures, blast walls. Historically the most catastrophic event in pulp mills.
- **Carbon disulfide (CS₂)**: Used in viscose production. Extremely flammable (auto-ignition 90°C — can ignite from hot steam pipe). Chronic exposure: peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular effects. Strict exposure limits: TLV-TWA 1 ppm.
- **Noise**: Paper machine operating at >90 dB(A) — hearing protection mandatory. Recovery boiler, refiners, and chip handling are also high-noise areas.
 - **Confined spaces**: Digester, evaporator bodies, and tanks require confined space entry procedures — atmospheric testing (O₂, H₂S, explosive limit), rescue plan, attendant at entry point.

## Sulfite Pulping

Though kraft pulping dominates modern production (~80% of chemical pulp), the acid sulfite process remains important for dissolving pulp and specialty grades. The chemistry differs fundamentally from kraft: sulfite cooking uses sulfur dioxide (SO₂) dissolved in water with various bases to produce bisulfite cooking liquor.

**Cooking liquor chemistry**: SO₂ dissolved in water forms sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃). Adding a base (CaCO₃, MgO, Na₂CO₃, or NH₄OH) produces the bisulfite ion (HSO₃⁻) that is the active delignifying agent. The base cation determines process pH and liquor properties. Calcium bisulfite was the original system (using cheap limestone), but CaSO₄ scaling limits recovery. Magnesium bisulfite is more common now, as MgSO₄ is recoverable by precipitation. Sodium and ammonia bases offer flexibility in pH.

**Cooking conditions**: Acidic sulfite (pH 1.5-4) cooks at 130-150°C for 6-12 hours, considerably longer than kraft (2-4 hours). The sulfonating action of HSO₃⁻ introduces sulfonate groups (-SO₃H) onto lignin, making it hydrophilic and water-soluble. This sulfonation mechanism differs from kraft's alkaline hydrolysis. The result: sulfite pulp is lighter in color (easier to bleach) and produces softer, more easily beaten fibers. Yield: 45-55% of wood mass (higher than kraft at 45-50% because sulfite preserves more hemicellulose).

**Limitations**: Sulfite pulping cannot process resinous softwoods (pine, Douglas fir) effectively. The extractives react with cooking chemicals to form insoluble pitch deposits. Feedstock limited to low-resin species: spruce, fir, hemlock, and hardwoods. Kraft has no such restriction, which is a major reason for its dominance.

## Bleaching Sequences in Detail

The traditional CEDED sequence (chlorination, alkali extraction, chlorine dioxide, extraction, chlorine dioxide) illustrates the stepwise logic of pulp bleaching. Each stage targets specific residual lignin structures.

**Chlorination (C stage)**: Elemental chlorine (Cl₂) at 0.05-0.15 kg per kg pulp, pH 1.5-2.0, 25-45°C, 30-60 minutes. Chlorine substitutes onto lignin aromatic rings (electrophilic substitution), chlorinating and oxidizing lignin into smaller, alkali-soluble fragments. This stage produces chlorinated organic byproducts including dioxins, which is why it has been largely abandoned in favor of ECF sequences.

**Alkali extraction (E stage)**: NaOH at 1-2% on pulp, 50-70°C, 60-90 minutes. Dissolves the chlorinated/oxidized lignin fragments from the C stage into solution. The brown-colored extract is washed away. Modern extraction stages often reinforce with oxygen (Eo stage, 0.5-1.0 MPa O₂) or hydrogen peroxide (Ep stage, 0.5-1.5% H₂O₂) for additional delignification without chlorine.

**[Modern ECF sequence (D₀EopD₁EPD₂)](../glossary/modern-ecf-sequence-deopdepd.md)** replaces the C stage with chlorine dioxide. ClO₂ performs selective oxidation rather than chlorination of lignin, reducing chlorinated organic formation by 90-95%. Typical chemical doses: ClO₂ at 0.8-1.5% active chlorine equivalent per D stage, NaOH at 0.8-1.5% per E stage, H₂O₂ at 0.5-1.0% in reinforced extraction stages.

**Bleaching yield loss**: Each bleaching stage dissolves additional material. Total yield loss through bleaching: 2-5% of pulp mass (mostly residual lignin and some hemicellulose). This represents a significant economic cost, as the dissolved organic material contributes to effluent load.

## Recovery Boiler Operation

The recovery boiler is simultaneously a chemical reactor and a steam generator. It serves two critical functions: recovering inorganic cooking chemicals from black liquor and generating process steam from the combustion of dissolved organic matter.

**Black liquor firing**: Concentrated black liquor (65-80% solids, heated to 110-120°C to reduce viscosity) is sprayed into the furnace through nozzles. The liquor droplets dry, pyrolyze, and burn in suspension. The organic component (lignin, hemicellulose degradation products) provides the fuel value. Black liquor heating value: 13-15 MJ/kg dry solids, roughly half that of coal.

**Smelt formation**: Inorganic sodium salts (Na₂CO₃ from the kraft cycle, plus Na₂SO₄ reduced to Na₂S) melt at the furnace bottom, forming a molten smelt pool at 800-1000°C. The smelt flows continuously through a water-cooled spout into a dissolving tank, where it is dissolved in weak wash liquor to form green liquor (Na₂CO₃ + Na₂S solution).

**Causticizing**: Green liquor is reacted with slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂) in a series of agitated tanks at 80-90°C. Na₂CO₃ + Ca(OH)₂ → 2NaOH + CaCO₃. The resulting CaCO₃ (lime mud) is filtered, washed, and sent to the lime kiln for reburning (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ at 900-1000°C). The regenerated white liquor (NaOH + Na₂S) returns to the digester, completing the chemical cycle. Causticizing efficiency: 80-85% per pass.

**Steam generation**: Recovery boiler steam pressure: 6-10 MPa, temperature 450-500°C. A modern kraft mill produces 2-5 tonnes of steam per tonne of pulp, sufficient to meet all mill energy needs with surplus for electricity generation via back-pressure turbines. Mills burning bark and other wood waste in auxiliary boilers produce additional power.

## Papermaking Additives

**Alum (aluminum sulfate, Al₂(SO₄)₃)**: The traditional papermaking chemical, used for over 150 years. Dissolves in water to form an acidic solution (pH 4.0-5.5). Functions: cationic charge source (attracts anionic fibers and fines), assists rosin sizing, scavenges anionic trash (dissolved and colloidal substances that interfere with wet-end chemistry). Drawback: acidic papermaking conditions degrade cellulose over decades (acid hydrolysis) — library books from 1900-1980 are crumbling. Modern neutral/alkaline papermaking (pH 7-8) uses AKD/ASA sizing instead, with PCC filler as the alkaline reserve.

**Rosin size**: Abietic acid and related resin acids (from tall oil rosin or gum rosin) act as hydrophobic sizing agents. Rosin is anionic and must be precipitated onto fiber surfaces by cationic alum. The rosin-alum complex renders fiber surfaces water-repellent. Rosin-alum sizing requires acidic papermaking conditions. Being replaced by alkaline sizing (AKD, ASA) in most applications.

**Starch**: Added at 0.5-2.5% on pulp at the wet end (cationic starch for retention) or applied as surface treatment at the size press. Dry strength additive: hydrogen bonding between starch hydroxyls and fiber hydroxyls increases tensile and burst strength 10-30%. Cationic starch (quaternary ammonium groups grafted onto starch backbone) also acts as a drainage and retention aid.

**Retention aids**: High-molecular-weight water-soluble polymers (1-20 million Da) that flocculate fine particles onto fiber surfaces. Cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) at 100-500 g/tonne is the primary retention aid. Combined with bentonite clay (microparticle system) or colloidal silica (nanoparticle system), these systems achieve first-pass retention >80%, reducing filler and fines loss to the white water circuit.

## Kraft Chemical Recovery Cycle

The kraft chemical cycle is one of the most elegant closed-loop chemical processes in industry. Over 95% of inorganic cooking chemicals are recovered and reused, and the organic waste stream (lignin and hemicellulose) provides the energy to drive the recovery.

**Sodium balance**: White liquor entering the digester contains NaOH (70-100 g/L as Na₂O) and Na₂S (20-40 g/L as Na₂O). The sulfidity ratio (Na₂S / (Na₂S + Na₂O)) is maintained at 25-35%. Higher sulfidity accelerates delignification but increases corrosion risk (sulfide is aggressive toward steel). Sodium lost in washing and spills is made up by adding Na₂SO₄ (salt cake) to the recovery boiler, where it reduces to Na₂S.

**H-factor calculation**: The H-factor combines temperature and time into a single number representing cooking severity. H = ∫ exp(43.2 - 16113/T) dt, where T is temperature in Kelvin and dt is time in hours. An H-factor of 800 corresponds to 90 minutes at 170°C, or 3 hours at 160°C. Softwood kraft typically targets H-factors of 800-2000, depending on the desired kappa number (residual lignin content). Kappa number 20-30 for bleachable grades, 60-80 for linerboard.

**Lime cycle**: The kraft mill operates a parallel calcium cycle. CaCO₃ (lime mud from causticizing) is fed to a lime kiln (2-4 m diameter × 40-80 m long rotary kiln, firing natural gas or fuel oil). Kiln temperature: 900-1100°C. CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂. CaO is slaked with water to Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime), which is then used to causticize green liquor. The lime kiln is the second-largest energy consumer in a kraft mill (after the recovery boiler), requiring 5-8 GJ per tonne of CaO produced. Lime mud reburning efficiency: 95-98%.

**White liquor preparation**: Green liquor (Na₂CO₃ + Na₂S from smelt dissolution, total titratable alkali 100-130 g/L as Na₂O) is causticized with slaked lime in a series of 3-5 agitated tanks at 80-90°C, total residence time 2-3 hours. Causticizing efficiency: 80-85%. The white liquor product contains NaOH and Na₂S at the target sulfidity. Unreacted CaCO₃ (lime mud) is separated by clarification and filtration, washed to recover entrained alkali, and returned to the lime kiln. White liquor is stored in covered steel tanks under a nitrogen blanket to prevent oxidation of Na₂S.

## Pulp Yield and Quality

**Kraft pulp yield**: Softwood kraft: 44-48% yield (based on dry wood mass). Hardwood kraft: 47-52%. The remainder (48-56% of wood) is dissolved as lignin, hemicellulose fragments, and extractives in the black liquor. Sulfite pulp yields are slightly higher (50-55%) because the acid process preserves more hemicellulose.

**Kappa number**: Measures residual lignin content in unbleached pulp. Determined by oxidizing a pulp sample with KMnO₄ under standardized conditions (ISO 302). Softwood kraft: kappa 25-35 for bleachable grades. Hardwood kraft: kappa 15-25. Higher kappa means more lignin remaining, requiring more bleaching chemicals but higher yield. Lower kappa means more delignification in the digester (lower yield) but less bleaching chemical needed.

**Brightness**: Measured as ISO brightness (% reflectance at 457 nm wavelength). Unbleached kraft pulp: 15-30% ISO. Fully bleached market pulp: 88-92% ISO. The difference represents the lignin removal achieved in the bleach plant. Brightness stability (resistance to yellowing on light/heat exposure) depends on the bleaching sequence used. TCF pulps may have slightly lower brightness ceiling than ECF but better stability in some cases due to different surface chemistry.

## Paper Machine Operations

**Headbox and forming**: The pulp slurry (0.5-1.5% consistency, meaning 0.5-1.5% fiber by mass in water) is pumped through the headbox onto a moving wire mesh (the "wire" — typically a synthetic fabric of polyester or nylon monofilaments woven to precise open area). Modern paper machines use a twin-wire former (pulp slurry injected between two converging wires) for better formation and higher speed. Water drains through the wire by gravity, suction, and table rolls. Fiber mat forms on the wire surface as water exits. Machine speed: 500-2000 m/min for newsprint, 100-500 m/min for heavy board.

**Press section**: The wet web (80-85% water after forming) passes through a series of press nips (two rolls squeezing the web against a felt blanket). Each nip removes water by mechanical pressure (5-20 MPa nip pressure). After 2-4 press nips, the web moisture drops to 55-65%. Felt design (needle-felted basalt or synthetic fiber) affects water removal and web surface quality. Shoe presses (extended nip with a concave press shoe inside a belt) increase pressing time from ~2 ms (conventional roll nip) to 20-50 ms, removing more water and improving web dryness to 45-50% moisture.

**Drying section**: Steam-heated dryer cylinders (1.5-2.0 m diameter cast iron cylinders, internally heated with steam at 0.3-1.0 MPa) evaporate the remaining water. A typical paper machine has 30-60 dryer cylinders arranged in groups. The web wraps around each cylinder in sequence, alternately touching the hot cylinder surface and passing through a free draw between cylinders. Drying rate: 10-30 kg water per m² per hour. Steam consumption: 1.5-2.5 kg steam per kg water evaporated. Condensate removed from dryer cylinders by rotary siphons (must be continuous; flooded cylinders lose heat transfer efficiency). Final paper moisture: 4-8% depending on grade.

**Calendering and reeling**: The dried paper passes through a calender stack (2-10 polished iron or steel rolls, heated to 50-200°C) to improve surface smoothness and gloss. Nip pressure 10-100 kN/m. Multiple nips progressively compress and smooth the surface. Soft-nip calenders (one steel roll paired with a polymer-covered roll) provide better gloss with less bulk loss. The finished paper is wound onto a steel reel core at the reel section (winding tension 0.5-3.0 N/cm width). A typical reel diameter is 2-3.5 m, containing 10-30 tonnes of paper.

## Environmental Considerations

**Effluent treatment**: Pulp mill effluent contains dissolved organic matter (BOD 20-50 mg/L for modern kraft mills), suspended solids, and chlorinated organic compounds (if chlorine-based bleaching is used). Biological treatment (activated sludge or aerated lagoon) reduces BOD by 90-95%. AOX (adsorbable organic halides) in effluent: <0.5 kg per tonne pulp for ECF mills, <0.1 kg/t for TCF mills. Unbleached mills produce essentially zero AOX.

**Air emissions**: Kraft mills emit reduced sulfur compounds (TRS — total reduced sulfur: H₂S, CH₃SH, CH₃SCH₃, CH₃SSCH₃) from the recovery boiler, lime kiln, and digestor relief. TRS compounds have extremely low odor thresholds (detectable at 1-10 ppb, causing the characteristic "rotten egg" smell near kraft mills). Collection and thermal oxidation in the recovery boiler or dedicated incinerator reduces TRS emissions to <5 ppm. NOx and SO₂ emissions from recovery boiler combustion controlled by boiler design and flue gas treatment.

**Water consumption**: Modern kraft mill: 20-50 m³ water per tonne of pulp. Older mills: 100+ m³/t. Water minimization through closed-loop white water systems (water from paper machine recycled to pulp washing), counter-current washing, and cooling water recirculation. Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) is technically achievable but expensive, requiring evaporation and crystallization of all wastewater.

## Dissolving Pulp and Regenerated Cellulose

**Viscose process parameters**: Dissolving pulp (92-96% α-cellulose) is steeped in 17.5-18% NaOH at 20-25°C for 30-60 minutes to form alkali cellulose. Excess NaOH is pressed out (press factor 2.8-3.2× original weight). The alkali cellulose is shredded to crumbs and aged (depolymerized) at 20-30°C for 12-48 hours in humidified air. Target degree of polymerization (DP): 300-500 for regular viscose, 200-280 for high-tenacity tire cord. After aging, the crumbs are reacted with CS₂ (30-35% on cellulose weight) at 25-30°C for 1-3 hours, forming orange sodium cellulose xanthate. The xanthate is dissolved in dilute NaOH (4-8%) to form viscose solution (8-10% cellulose, 5-7% NaOH). Ripening: 18-30 hours at 18-22°C, during which the xanthate groups redistribute and the viscosity drops and then rises to spinning consistency. The viscose is filtered (3-4 stages), deaerated, and extruded through spinnerets (10,000-40,000 holes, 50-100 μm diameter) into a coagulation bath (8-12% H₂SO₄, 20-28% Na₂SO₄, 0.5-2% ZnSO₄ at 45-55°C). The sulfuric acid regenerates cellulose from xanthate. ZnSO₄ slows regeneration, improving fiber strength and uniformity.

**Lyocell process**: Cellulose is dissolved directly in NMMO (N-methylmorpholine N-oxide) monohydrate at 100-130°C under vacuum to achieve 10-15% cellulose concentration. The solution is filtered and extruded through spinnerets into a water coagulation bath. No CS₂ or H₂S is involved. The NMMO solvent is recovered from the coagulation bath by evaporation (>99.5% recovery rate) and recycled. Fiber properties: higher tenacity (40-45 cN/tex dry, 35-40 wet) than viscose (20-25 dry, 10-15 wet) because the direct dissolution preserves cellulose chain length. Applications: textiles (Tencel brand), nonwovens, and specialty papers.

## Recovery Boiler Energy Balance

**Steam generation**: The recovery boiler is the primary steam source in a kraft mill. Black liquor firing rate: 2000-6000 tonnes dry solids per day for a modern mill. Steam production: 3-6 tonnes steam per tonne of black liquor dry solids. Steam conditions: 6-10 MPa, 450-520°C (high enough for efficient electricity generation in back-pressure turbines). Electrical generation: 30-80 MW from recovery boiler steam, depending on mill size and steam conditions.

**Thermal efficiency**: Recovery boiler efficiency: 60-68% (based on heat absorbed as steam / HHV of black liquor solids). The remaining 32-40% is lost as: dry flue gas heat loss (15-20%), moisture in black liquor (5-10% for 75% solids firing), radiation and convection (2-3%), unburned carbon in smelt (1-2%). Increasing black liquor solids concentration from 65% to 80% (using additional evaporation capacity) reduces moisture heat loss by 5-8%, significantly improving boiler efficiency.

## Evaporation and Black Liquor Concentration

**Multi-effect evaporation**: Black liquor from the digester (15-18% solids) must be concentrated to 65-80% solids before firing in the recovery boiler. This is done in multiple-effect evaporators: a series of 5-7 steam-heated evaporator bodies operating at progressively lower pressures. First effect: live steam at 0.3-0.5 MPa heats the black liquor, boiling off water vapor. This vapor becomes the heating steam for the second effect (which operates at lower pressure, lower boiling point). Each subsequent effect uses the previous effect's vapor as its heat source. Steam economy: 4-6 kg water evaporated per kg of live steam (a 6-effect evaporator). Total evaporation: 4-6 tonnes of water removed per tonne of black liquor dry solids (concentrating from 16% to 75% solids).

**Falling film evaporator**: Modern evaporators use falling film design. Black liquor is distributed over the top of vertical tube bundles (or plate packs) and flows downward as a thin film while steam condenses on the opposite side of the tubes. Heat transfer coefficient: 800-2000 W/m²·K for dilute liquor, decreasing to 300-800 W/m²·K for concentrated liquor (viscosity increases dramatically above 50% solids). Heat transfer area: 5,000-15,000 m² total for a large mill.

**Liquor viscosity management**: Above 55-60% solids at ambient temperature, black liquor becomes too viscous to pump (viscosity >500 mPa·s). Solutions: (1) maintain liquor temperature above 80°C (viscosity decreases exponentially with temperature), (2) add lignin-derived viscosity reducers, (3) use high-solids concentrators (forced circulation evaporators operating at 110-130°C under pressure). The final concentration step often uses a direct-contact evaporator (flue gas from the recovery boiler contacts and concentrates the liquor) or a superconcentrator (steam-heated forced-circulation evaporator operating at 130-150°C).

## Tall Oil Processing

**Crude tall oil composition**: 30-50% rosin acids (abietic acid, pimaric acid), 30-50% fatty acids (oleic acid, linoleic acid), 5-20% neutral materials (sterols, hydrocarbons, lignin). Composition varies with wood species: softwood pulping produces more rosin; hardwood produces more fatty acids. Global crude tall oil production: ~2 million tonnes/year, entirely from kraft softwood pulping.

**Tall oil fractionation**: Crude tall oil is distilled under vacuum (5-20 mmHg) to separate fractions. The distillation column (8-12 m tall, packed with structured packing) operates at 200-260°C bottom temperature. Products drawn at different heights: heads/pitch (bottoms, bp >260°C, used as fuel or asphalt modifier), tall oil rosin (TOR, 240-260°C fraction, used in paper sizing, adhesives, and printing inks), tall oil fatty acids (TOFA, 200-240°C, used in alkyd resins, soaps, dimer acids for polyamide resins), and distilled tall oil (DTO, 180-200°C, used as emulsifiers). Each fraction requires further purification by washing, bleaching, and redistillation depending on the application.

**Tall oil rosin in paper sizing**: TOR is reacted with maleic anhydride to form maleated rosin, then neutralized with NaOH to form sodium rosinate (rosin soap). This rosin size is applied to pulp fibers with alum as the mordant, providing water resistance to the finished paper. The rosin-alum complex deposits on fiber surfaces, making them hydrophobic. Dosage: 0.5-2.0% rosin on dry fiber weight, with 2-4% alum. This traditional sizing system operates at pH 4.0-5.5 (acidic papermaking conditions).

## Pulp Washing Efficiency

**Brown stock washing**: After kraft cooking, the pulp fibers are separated from the black liquor by a series of counter-current washing stages. Rotary vacuum washers (drum filters, 3-5 m diameter, rotating at 2-5 RPM) are the traditional technology. Each washer removes 80-90% of the soluble solids from the pulp mat. With 3-4 stages in counter-current arrangement, overall washing efficiency reaches 96-99%. Wash water consumption: 8-15 m³ per tonne of pulp. The dilution factor (ratio of wash water to original liquor in the pulp) determines the tradeoff between washing efficiency (more water = cleaner pulp) and evaporation load (more water = more energy to concentrate the black liquor).

**Diffusion washing**: An alternative to rotary washers, using a stationary pressure vessel where pulp moves upward while wash water flows downward through a series of screens. Longer contact time (30-60 minutes vs 10-30 seconds for rotary washers) provides more efficient mass transfer. Dilution factor: 2.5-3.5 m³ water per tonne pulp (lower than rotary washers). Used in modern mills for its compact footprint and superior washing with less water.

**COD and BOD in wash water**: The effluent from pulp washing contains dissolved organic material measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD, 1000-5000 mg/L) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅, 300-1500 mg/L). Modern mills treat this effluent in biological wastewater treatment (activated sludge at 0.5-2.0 kg BOD/kg MLSS/day, retention time 4-8 hours) before discharge. Treatment efficiency: 90-95% BOD removal.

## Market and Scale

**Global pulp production**: ~190 million tonnes/year (2020s). Chemical pulp (kraft + sulfite): ~140 million tonnes. Mechanical pulp: ~30 million tonnes. Recovered paper (recycled): ~250 million tonnes collected, representing ~50-60% of global papermaking furnish. The largest kraft pulp mills produce 3,000-6,000 tonnes/day of air-dry pulp (90% consistency). A world-scale mill consumes 10,000-20,000 m³ of wood per day, requiring a secure wood supply from managed forest plantations within 100-200 km transport radius.

**Pulp grade classification**: Market pulp (sold on the open market) vs. integrated pulp (produced and consumed at the same mill site, directly feeding the paper machine). Softwood kraft: long fibers for strength (packaging, linerboard). Hardwood kraft: short fibers for smoothness and printability (copy paper, magazine paper). Dissolving pulp: high-purity cellulose for regenerated fibers and chemicals. Bleached vs. unbleached: bleaching adds $50-100/tonne to production cost but is required for printing and writing grades.

## Non-Wood Fiber Pulping

**Bamboo pulp**: Bamboo (Bambusa species) contains 40-50% cellulose, making it a viable pulp feedstock. Used extensively in India and China where bamboo is abundant. Kraft pulping of bamboo: similar conditions to hardwood, yield 42-48%. Fiber length 1.5-3.0 mm (comparable to softwood), giving excellent strength properties. Annual yield per hectare: 20-40 tonnes dry matter (vs 5-15 for managed softwood forest with 20-30 year rotation). Bamboo can be harvested every 3-5 years, making it a rapidly renewable fiber source. Processing challenges: high silica content (1-3%) causes scaling in evaporators and recovery boilers.

**Bagasse pulp**: Sugarcane bagasse (the fibrous residue after juice extraction) is 30-40% of cane mass. Composition: cellulose 40-45%, hemicellulose 25-30%, lignin 18-22%. Pith (soft interior) must be removed by depithing (mechanical separation) before pulping as it consumes chemicals without contributing fiber. Bagasse pulp yield: 45-50% by kraft process. Major producers: Brazil, India, China, and Cuba. Used for newsprint, tissue, and corrugating medium. The seasonal nature of sugarcane harvesting requires pulp mills to store 6-12 months of bagasse (baled and stored outdoors, moisture <20% to prevent biological degradation).

**Recycled fiber processing**: Recovered paper is pulped in a hydrapulper (helical rotor at 4-6% consistency, 20-30 minutes), deinked (surfactant + air flotation removes ink particles 10-150 μm), cleaned (heavy and light contaminant removal), and bleached (H₂O₂ or FAS reductive bleaching). Yield: 75-85% of input recovered paper becomes reusable fiber. Recycled fiber is shorter and weaker than virgin fiber (each recycling cycle shortens fibers by 10-20%), limiting the number of times paper can be recycled to 5-7 cycles before fiber quality is inadequate for papermaking.

The global shift toward sustainable packaging is driving renewed investment in cellulose-based materials, positioning pulp chemistry as a growth industry for the 21st century.
